# 🤖 Multi-User AI Agent Chatbot

This project is a **hands-on implementation of a multi-user conversational AI system** using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. It simulates multiple users interacting with AI agents simultaneously, with independent session handling, contextual memory, and collaborative workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement an **AI-powered multi-user chatbot** capable of:
- Managing multiple conversations in parallel
- Maintaining **contextual memory per user**
- using different tools like web search and weather api according to user querry .
- ReAct based architecture.
- Demonstrating how LangChain + LangGraph can orchestrate complex multi-agent dialogue systems

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Multi-user support** with independent contexts
- 🧠 **Conversation memory** for maintaining user history
- 🔄 **Parallel conversation execution**
- 📌 **Session-based AI responses** 
- 🛠️ **LangChain chains integration** for structured reasoning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- OpenAI API
- Pandas (for logging results)
- Jupyter Notebook
- weather api
- TavilySearch api
